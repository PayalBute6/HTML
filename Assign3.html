    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    <img src="albert_einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein">
    <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mcÂ², which has been described as "the world's most famous equation."</p>
