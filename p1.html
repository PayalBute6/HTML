<h3>Blinded by power, Bhima tried to destroy the Shivlinga with his sword, but Lord Shiva appeared at the site and killed him to save the innocent king. After that, all Gods appeared there and requested Shiva to stay in the place as a Jyotirlinga, which came to be known as Bhimshankar Jyotirlinga.<h3>
